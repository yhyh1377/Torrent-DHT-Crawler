# DHT Crawler
This DHT crawler in Python is designed to find and output magnet links without obtaining peers or meta information about the magnets. The crawler is super fast and has a success rate of around 50% in finding magnet links that are alive and have peers associated with them.

# Speed
The DHT crawler operates at a speed of 1000 magnet links per second with a network speed of 1.5 MB. (Very Very FAST)

# Future Improvements
In the future, potential enhancements could include the capability to extract magnet links by IP address and port, providing more detailed insights into the availability and connectivity of peers.
